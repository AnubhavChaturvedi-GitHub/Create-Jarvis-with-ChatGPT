**Python Script for Fast and Efficient Speech-to-Text Recognition**

Write a Python script that recognizes speech using the `speech_recognition` module while automating the installation of required packages via the `subprocess` module. Ensure the script uses advanced configurations of `sr.Recognizer` for optimal performance. Implement and configure the following parameters to achieve the fastest and most accurate results:

```python
r = sr.Recognizer()
r.dynamic_energy_adjustment_damping = 0.3
r.dynamic_energy_ratio = 0.9
r.dynamic_energy_threshold = False
r.pause_threshold = 0.5
r.operation_timeout = None
r.non_speaking_duration = 0.5
```

Ensure the script demonstrates fast and efficient real-time speech recognition by handling background noise and optimizing speed.
